# Quantum Assembly — Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Vision

Quantum Assembly is a Python framework that enables developers to write quantum algorithms using familiar programming constructs — arithmetic operators, comparisons, conditionals — without ever touching quantum gates. The framework compiles this high-level code into optimized quantum circuits automatically.

**Current milestone**: Per-variable history graph and automatic uncomputation — replacing legacy layer-based uncomputation with per-variable history graphs, triggered by `__exit__`, `__del__`, and measurement. *(Completed)*

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 The Compilation Pipeline Problem

As quantum algorithms grow in complexity, the compilation pipeline must accurately track resource usage (gate counts, qubit allocation) and expose parallelism opportunities. The previous call graph used overlap-based edges that scaled quadratically with operation count and did not reflect true execution ordering. Accurate gate counts were not propagated from the C backend through to the Python-level DAG.

---

## 3. Users

### 3.1 Primary User

Quantum algorithm researchers and developers who use the Quantum Assembly framework to design, implement, and test quantum algorithms.

### 3.2 User Expectations

- Write algorithm code using Python arithmetic and comparisons; the framework handles circuit generation.
- Accurate resource estimation (gate counts, qubit usage) from the compilation pipeline.
- Clear visualization of the operation DAG for debugging and optimization.

## 4. Requirements

### P0 — Must Have

#### R7: Circuit Compilation Pipeline

Call graph-based compilation pipeline with accurate resource tracking.

| ID | Requirement | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| R7.1 | Call graph DAG tracks compiled operations with qubit sets and gate metadata. | **Done** |
| R7.2 | Tracking-only mode: count gates without simulating (no state vector). | **Done** |
| R7.3 | Gate counting on replay: cached sequences report correct counts. | **Done** |
| R7.4 | Cython operations wired to call graph recording during `@ql.compile`. | **Done** |
| R7.5 | Execution-order edges: edges represent sequential ordering, absence of edges means parallelism. Edge from A→B iff B runs after A and they share qubits. | **Done** |
| R7.6 | Flat operation DAG: no wrapper/function nodes. Operations are direct DAG nodes. | **Done** |
| R7.7 | Graph immutability: after capture, the call graph is frozen. Replay reads only. | **Done** |
| R7.8 | Gate counts on sequences: `sequence_t` stores `total_gate_count`, computed at creation time. | **Done** |
| R7.9 | Hardcoded counts: all precompiled/hardcoded sequences include correct gate counts. | **Done** |
| R7.10 | Gate counts flow from C sequences through `_record_operation` into `DAGNode`. | **Done** |

#### R11: Automatic Uncomputation

Per-variable history graph system replacing legacy layer-based uncomputation.

| ID | Requirement | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| R11.1 | `HistoryGraph` data structure with append, reverse iteration, weakref children, discard. | **Done** |
| R11.2 | Arithmetic/comparison/bitwise operations record `(sequence_ptr, qubit_mapping, num_ancilla)` into result's history graph. | **Done** |
| R11.3 | `__exit__` uncomputes condition qbool's history in reverse, cascading to orphaned children via weakrefs. | **Done** |
| R11.4 | `__del__` triggers uncomputation when circuit is active; circuit-active guard prevents shutdown firing. | **Done** |
| R11.5 | Measurement discards history graph (collapsed qubits cannot be uncomputed). | **Done** |
| R11.6 | `atexit` hook sets `_circuit_active=False` to prevent `__del__` during interpreter shutdown. | **Done** |
| R11.7 | Legacy layer-based uncomputation (`_start_layer`, `_end_layer`, `_auto_uncompute`) removed. | **Done** |
| R11.8 | End-to-end integration tests covering all uncomputation triggers and edge cases. | **Done** |

#### R12: Quantum Walk Rework

Function-based quantum walk API replacing the monolithic QWalkTree class.

| ID | Requirement | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| R12.1 | `walk(is_marked, max_depth, num_moves, *, state, make_move, is_valid)` — builds `WalkConfig` with marking, allocates `WalkRegisters`, returns `(config, registers)`. All parameters required. Detection via phase estimation is a future milestone. | **Done** |
| R12.2 | `walk_diffusion(state, make_move, is_valid, num_moves)` — local diffusion building block. Single implementation path: always evaluates validity quantumly (no fixed-branching shortcut). | **Done** |
| R12.3 | User provides `make_move(state, move_index)` as `@ql.compile(inverse=True)` function. `move_index` is a classical int; the function uses DSL operations (arithmetic, XOR, `with`) — never raw gates. | **Done** |
| R12.4 | User provides `is_valid(state)` and `is_marked(state)` as quantum predicates returning `qbool`. | **Done** |
| R12.5 | Framework manages height register (one-hot), branch registers (one per depth), and count register internally. User never sees these. | **Done** |
| R12.6 | Counting loop: for each move index, apply move → check validity → increment count → undo move. Operates correctly across all computational basis states. | **Done** |
| R12.7 | Conditional branching: Montanaro rotation angles based on count value, creating uniform superposition over valid moves. Includes parent/self component for probability backflow. | **Done** |
| R12.8 | R_A / R_B walk operators: local diffusions at even/odd depths controlled on height register. walk_step = R_B * R_A. | **Done** |
| R12.9 | Detection via quantum phase estimation (Montanaro 2015, Theorem 1). Future milestone — `walk()` returns `(config, registers)` for now. | |
| R12.10 | XOR-based state manipulation replaces raw qubit index manipulation (e.g., `x ^= value` instead of `emit_x(qubit_idx)`). | **Done** |
| R12.11 | Old `QWalkTree` class and `walk.py` removed entirely, along with all associated test files. | **Done** |
| R12.12 | Each implementation file ≤ 400 LOC. | **Done** |
| R12.13 | Correctness verified on tiny problems (≤ 17 qubits) via Qiskit simulation. | **Done** |
| R12.14 | `is_marked` evaluated quantumly, returning `qbool`. Marking = identity (D_x = I for marked nodes per Montanaro 2015). Works with variable-branching diffusion via controlled XOR (Toffoli). | **Done** |
| R12.15 | `walk_operators.py` composes `walk_diffusion.py` — no reimplementation of diffusion logic in the operator layer. | **Done** |
| R12.16 | Single diffusion implementation: variable-branching only. No `_fixed_diffusion` path — fixed branching converges to plain Grover's (use `ql.grover()` for that). | **Done** |
| R12.17 | Marking integrated with variable-branching path: `with ~marked:` wraps the variable diffusion call. No separate marking dispatch. | **Done** |

#### R13: Quantum Walk Skill

Claude Code skill (`/quantum-walk`) for guided development of walk functions.

| ID | Requirement | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| R13.1 | Structured discussion phase: state, moves, validity, marking, parameters. | |
| R13.2 | Quantum function generation following DSL rules (`with` vs `if`, `@ql.compile(inverse=True)`, XOR idioms). | |
| R13.3 | Automatic classical equivalent generation (with→if, qint→int, qbool→bool). | |
| R13.4 | CC-as-oracle verification loop: generate scenarios, run classical equivalents, CC judges correctness. Monte Carlo coverage with k≥20 random inputs. | |
| R13.5 | Independent verifier agent; flags user only for exotic/custom problems. | |
| R13.6 | Idiom library: ternary assignment, XOR-based modification, counting, compound validity, all-assigned check. Extensible over time. | |

#### R14: DSL Purity & Simulate-Mode Cleanup

Eliminate all local `simulate` toggles and raw gate patterns from walk modules. The `simulate` option is global — internal helpers must never toggle it.

| ID | Requirement | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| R14.1 | `simulate` is a global option only. Remove all local `option('simulate', ...)` toggles from `_flip_all`, `diffusion()` wrapper, and any other internal helper. Tests that need QASM output must set `ql.option('simulate', True)` in their fixture. | **Done** |
| R14.2 | Controlled-AND support: `&` operator inside `with` blocks (controlled context) must work. Implement via C-CCX decomposition (Toffoli + ancilla). Currently raises `NotImplementedError`. | **Done** |
| R14.3 | Replace `_flip_all` single-register calls with `^= 1` or `~reg` directly. Keep `_flip_all` only as multi-register convenience (without simulate toggle). | **Done** |
| R14.4 | Replace `_nested_phase_flip` and `_apply_nested_with` (recursive nested `with` loops) with flat `&`-chain pattern. Depends on R14.2. | **Done** |
| R14.5 | Raise test qubit budget from 17 to 21. Statevector simulation at 21 qubits takes ~0.2s (2M amplitudes), well within acceptable limits. | **Done** |
| R14.6 | `qarray.all()` primitive for multi-controlled operations (future optimization): replace manual `&`-chain loops with internal AND-reduction. Fewer allocations, potential gate-level optimization. | |

#### R15: In-Place Comparison Operators

Replace copy-based `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` with in-place borrow-ancilla pattern. Eliminates widened temporary copies and reduces qubit overhead.

| ID | Requirement | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| R15.1 | `__lt__` and `__gt__` use borrow-ancilla pattern: allocate single ancilla as (n+1)th bit, perform (n+1)-bit subtraction across `[a, ancilla]`, extract borrow into result qbool, restore via addition, deallocate ancilla. No operand copies. | |
| R15.2 | `__le__` and `__ge__` automatically benefit (implemented as `~(a > b)` / `~(a < b)`). | |
| R15.3 | Arithmetic backend supports subtraction/addition across a qint + separate qbool as a split register (qbool acts as MSB). | |
| R15.4 | No history graph children for comparison temporaries — borrow ancilla is deallocated immediately. | |
| R15.5 | Both operands unchanged after comparison (operand preservation). | |

#### R16: Compiled Function Control Propagation

Fix `@ql.compile` to correctly propagate control context from `with` blocks.

| ID | Requirement | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| R16.1 | Single cache entry stores both uncontrolled (canonical) and derived controlled gate sequences. | |
| R16.2 | Capture always produces uncontrolled gates (control stack cleared). Controlled variant derived mechanically via `_derive_controlled_block`. | |
| R16.3 | `run_instruction` selects controlled vs uncontrolled sequence at runtime based on control stack. Control qubit index mapped dynamically. | |
| R16.4 | Nested `with` blocks collapse to single control via AND-ancilla. Single-control derivation suffices for all nesting depths. | |
| R16.5 | `opt=1` (DAG-only) mode respects control context. | |

#### R17: History Graph Inverse Cancellation

Detect and cancel manual uncomputation in the history graph, avoiding redundant inverse gates.

| ID | Requirement | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| R17.1 | Tail-only matching: when an operation is the exact inverse of the last history entry and no active blockers exist, cancel both entries. | |
| R17.2 | Supported inverse pairs: `+= k` / `-= k`, `^= x` / `^= x` (self-inverse), `f()` / `f.inverse()` (matched by sequence pointer). | |
| R17.3 | Blocker mechanism: when a qint is used as a source operand (RHS), a blocker is added to its history referencing the dependent qint. | |
| R17.4 | Blockers cleared on qubit deallocation (uncomputation) of the dependent qint, not on Python GC. Explicit notification mechanism. | |
| R17.5 | No cancellation if active blockers exist after the last history entry. Operation added as normal entry instead. | |
| R17.6 | `*= k` / `//= k` inverse cancellation deferred to future work. | |

### P1 — Should Have

#### R8: Future Compilation Improvements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| R8.1 | Complete and working optimization flags (`opt=0`, `opt=1`, `opt=2`). |
| R8.2 | Streaming gate application (gates applied to QPU without full circuit storage). |

### P2 — Nice to Have

#### R9: Code Maintenance

General improvements to the existing codebase.

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| R9.1 | Performance optimization of hot paths in gate emission. |
| R9.2 | Memory footprint reduction. |
| R9.3 | Stability improvements and edge case fixes. |
| R9.4 | Reduction of generated sequence file bloat. |

#### R10: Codebase Cleanup

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| R10.1 | Remove dead code and unused modules. |
| R10.2 | Consolidate duplicated logic. |
| R10.3 | Standardize naming conventions across Python and C layers. |

## 5. Success Criteria

### 5.0 Call Graph & Compilation Pipeline

- 10 consecutive additions on the same integer produce exactly 10 edges (linear chain), not C(10,2) = 45 overlap edges.
- Operations on disjoint qubits produce parallel branches (no edges between them).
- An operation touching qubits from two independent branches produces edges to both (merge node).
- All nodes reachable from root.
- Graph is unchanged after replay of a compiled function.
- All sequences (including hardcoded) report non-zero gate counts that match actual gate content.
- DAGNode.gate_count is populated from sequence data, not hardcoded to 0.

### 5.0b In-Place Comparisons

- `a < b` and `a > b` allocate at most 1 ancilla qubit (borrow bit), not 2×(n+1)-bit temporary copies.
- Both operands are unchanged after comparison (statevector verification).
- No history graph children created for comparison temporaries.
- Gate count reduced compared to copy-based approach.
- All existing comparison tests pass with identical results.

### 5.0c Compiled Function Control Propagation

- Calling a compiled function inside `with ctrl:` produces a different gate sequence than calling it uncontrolled.
- A single cache entry contains both variants; replay does not re-capture.
- Nested `with c1: with c2: f(x)` produces correct combined-controlled gates.
- `opt=1` mode correctly handles controlled context.

### 5.0d History Graph Inverse Cancellation

- `a += 3; a -= 3` results in empty history for `a`.
- `a ^= 5; a ^= 5` results in empty history for `a`.
- `f(a); f.inverse(a)` results in empty history for `a`.
- `a += 3; b += a; a -= 3` does NOT cancel (blocker from `b` is active).
- `a += 3; b += a; del b; a -= 3` DOES cancel (blocker cleared on `b`'s deallocation).
- No cancellation attempted for `*=` / `//=`.

### 5.1 Quantum Walk Rework

- `ql.walk()` returns `(config, registers)` for use with `walk_step`. Detection via phase estimation is a future milestone.
- `ql.walk_diffusion()` satisfies reflection property: D² = I (statevector amplitude tolerance ~1e-6).
- Counting loop produces correct valid-child count across superposition of basis states.
- R_A and R_B operate on disjoint height register qubits (even vs odd depths).
- walk_step = R_B * R_A compiles and replays correctly (gate sequence cached).
- Old `walk.py` and all associated test files removed.
- All test circuits use ≤ 21 qubits (raised from 17; 21-qubit statevector simulation ~0.2s).
- No implementation file exceeds 400 LOC.
- `/quantum-walk` skill produces correct quantum functions with passing verification loop.
- Marking is quantum: `is_marked(state)` returns `qbool`, diffusion applied only to unmarked nodes (`with ~marked:`). No classical enumeration.
- No `emit_x` in walk modules — all state manipulation via DSL operators.
- `walk_operators.py` calls into `walk_diffusion.py` — no duplicated diffusion logic.
- Single diffusion path: variable-branching only. No fixed-branching shortcut.
- `walk()` requires `state`, `make_move`, `is_valid` — no optional-but-actually-needed parameters.

---

## 7. Technical Constraints

| Constraint | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| 21-qubit simulation ceiling | Cannot verify algorithms at scale via quantum simulation |
| Division/modulo requires classical divisor | Limits some encoding strategies |
| Arithmetic backend assumes contiguous registers | Split-register operations (qint + qbool as MSB) require backend extension for in-place comparisons |

---

### Milestone 2: Quantum Walk Rework — Initial Implementation *(completed, needs bug fixes)*

- Function-based walk API: `ql.walk()` and `ql.walk_diffusion()` replace monolithic `QWalkTree`
- User provides `make_move`, `is_valid`, `is_marked` as quantum functions using DSL
- Framework manages height register, branch registers, counting, Montanaro diffusion angles
- Counting loop: apply-check-undo per move, in superposition across all basis states
- Conditional branching with parent/self component for probability backflow
- R_A/R_B walk operators, walk_step = R_B * R_A
- Claude Code skill (`/quantum-walk`) for guided quantum walk function development
- Correctness verified on tiny (≤ 17 qubit) problems via simulation

### Milestone 2b: Quantum Walk Bug Fixes *(completed)*

Fixed correctness bugs discovered during review of the initial walk implementation:

- **Quantum marking**: Replaced classical `is_marked` evaluation with quantum evaluation: `is_marked(state)` returns `qbool`, marking = identity (D_x = I per Montanaro 2015)
- **Remove `emit_x`**: Replaced all `emit_x(qubit_idx)` with DSL equivalents via `_flip_all` helper
- **Remove classical detection**: Removed simulation-based overlap detection; `walk()` returns `(config, registers)` for manual walk step iteration. Phase estimation detection is a future milestone.
- **Deduplicate operators**: `walk_operators.py` now composes `walk_diffusion.py` via `control_qubit` parameter
- **Remove `walk.py`**: Deleted the deprecated `QWalkTree` class and all associated test files
- **Rewrite `walk_search.py`**: `walk()` builds `WalkConfig` with `is_marked` and returns `(config, registers)`

### Milestone 2c: Unify Diffusion Path *(completed)*

Simplifies the walk implementation by removing the fixed-branching diffusion path and unifying on variable-branching diffusion as the single implementation:

- **Remove `_fixed_diffusion`**: The fixed-branching path assumes all `num_moves` children are always valid (classical `int d`). This is only correct for perfectly regular trees with no pruning — but the whole point of backtracking is pruning via `is_valid`. The fixed case converges to plain Grover's algorithm, which already has `ql.grover()`. Remove `_fixed_diffusion`, `walk_diffusion_fixed`, and `_apply_fixed_diffusion`.
- **Marking on variable-branching path**: Remove the warning that marking is ignored in variable branching. Controlled XOR inside `with ~marked:` decomposes to Toffoli gates, which the framework handles natively. Wrap `_variable_diffusion` with `with ~marked:` in `_apply_local_diffusion`.
- **Require `state`, `make_move`, `is_valid` in `walk()`**: These are no longer optional. Every walk needs a state register and move/validity callbacks. Simplifies the API and removes the three-way dispatch.
- **Test consolidation**: Remove fixed-branching tests, update marking tests to use variable branching. Net LOC reduction in both implementation and tests.

### Milestone 2d: DSL Purity & Simulate-Mode Cleanup *(completed)*

- Removed all local `option('simulate', ...)` toggles from internal helpers
- Implemented controlled-AND (`&` inside `with` blocks) via C-CCX decomposition
- Replaced single-register `_flip_all` calls with `^= 1` / `~` DSL operators
- Replaced recursive nested `with` patterns with flat `&`-chain + single `with combined:` block
- Raised test qubit budget from 17 to 21

### Milestone 3: In-Place Comparison Operators

Replace copy-based `<`/`>`/`<=`/`>=` with borrow-ancilla pattern:

- Extend arithmetic backend to support split-register subtraction/addition (qint + separate qbool as MSB)
- Rewrite `__lt__` and `__gt__` in `qint_comparison.pxi` to use borrow-ancilla
- Remove widened temporary copy logic and history graph child tracking for comparisons
- Verify operand preservation and result correctness via statevector simulation

### Milestone 4: Compiled Function Control Propagation

Fix `@ql.compile` to correctly handle `with` block control context:

- Single cache entry stores both uncontrolled and derived controlled gate sequences
- `run_instruction` selects sequence at runtime based on control stack
- Control qubit index mapped dynamically (gate sequences themselves are fixed)
- Verify controlled vs uncontrolled produce different gate sequences with `simulate=True`

### Milestone 5: History Graph Inverse Cancellation

Detect and cancel manual uncomputation in the history graph:

- Add blocker mechanism: source operand usage adds blockers referencing dependent qints
- Blockers cleared on qubit deallocation (explicit notification, not Python GC)
- Tail-only cancellation for `+=`/`-=`, `^=` self-inverse, `f()`/`f.inverse()` pairs
- `*=`/`//=` deferred to future work

## 9. Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
